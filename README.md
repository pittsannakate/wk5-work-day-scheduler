# wk5-work-day-scheduler
  
  // WHEN I open the planner
  // THEN the current day and time is displayed at the top of the calendar
I found a resource for this function to list the day and time of each.

// WHEN I scroll down
  // THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours

in the HTML, I found a bootstrap framework to create the buttons. I have seen several others use the same. 

  // WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
  // THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past (gray), present (red), or future (green)

  since it is so late, I have no idea if the color coding is working- maybe there's a way to check that? it was working earlier so hopefully I didn't mess that one up. But I used a similar bootstrap framework to create the time logic.

  Then, I created variables for each time to get from local storage. I have also tried several things here, but the Local storage isn't working when I refresh. I definitely did something wrong.
